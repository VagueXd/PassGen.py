# PassGen.py

This is just a starter project I made that helps create random and unique passwords.
 - Chooses first 4 characters each from Small letters, Capital letters, Numbers, and Special characters.
 - Then chooses randomly from all of the characters.
 - Looks out that two consecutive characters aren't of the same type.
 - That's all for now.
